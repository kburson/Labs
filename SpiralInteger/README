SpiralInteger

this is a maven project.  Run the following command:
 
mvn clean package

 to get an executable jar, then execute the jar with :

java -jar SpiralInteger-1.0-*.jar <args...>

The main app will take an infinite list of integer values.  
Each value will generate and print a spiral matrix of all integers from 0 to the value entered.

If the value entered is < 0 the matrix will reverse the spiral (print backwards)

If a value is preceeded with the word 'primes' then only the prime numbers in the spiral will print

If the value is preceeded with both 'star' then all numbers will be replaced with '*'.

Try the following input:

72 -72 primes 72 star primes 72 star 72
